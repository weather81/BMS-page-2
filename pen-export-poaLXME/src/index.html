<p>Now a days, Li-ion batteries are quite possibly the most exceptional battery powered
batteries; these are drawing in much consideration from recent many years. Lithium-ion
batteries, which are completely utilised in portable gadgets & electric vehicles, are the
driving force behind the digital technological revolution in todayâ€™s mobile societies. In
order to protect and maintain voltage and current of the battery with in safe limit Battery
Management System (BMS) should be used. BMS provides thermal management to the
battery, safeguarding it against over and under temperature and also during short circuit
conditions. The battery pack is designed with series connected cells produce 12V. The
charging and releasing levels of the battery pack is indicated by interfacing the MSP430
microcontroller . The SOC of the battery is a vital information to the EV user. It can be
displayed as the percentage of full charge capacity that is still available from the battery
or be used to estimate the vehicle range based on additional information from previous
driving cycles. However, it can not be measured directly from the battery and have a
strong dependence with the temperature and the operating conditions
